# Prediction-of-Purchasing-Intention-Using-Bagging-Boosting-Stacking-ensembles
The core idea of Ensemble Learning is to aggregate the results of several classifier models into a single model that performs better than any of the individual models that constitute it. Model Bagging achieves this by training several homogeneous weak learners in parallel and then averaging their results, Model Boosting trains several homogeneous weak learners sequentially before combining their results and Model Stacking combines together several heterogeneous models and makes use of of a meta-model to select the best predictions of each base model for each instance. This project details the individual steps carried out in this project which was carried out entirely in Python 3 (using Jupyter Notebook ) from the Objectives to the Methodology where the data pre-processing and transformation is discussed. After that, how each modelling method and algorithm implemented used is also shown and finally, a comparative analysis is conducted on the results of each of the three Ensemble methods used in order to demonstrate the limits of each approach. In its conclusion, other related work and possible areas of model accuracy improvement are discussed
